# PS1_De-Dither_GUI
Simple GUI for the PS1 De-Dither patch.
It allows game file scanning (with .cue&.bin format) and batch patching, as well as various file save/backup option.

Coded by Jean-Baptiste Bongrand.

This app uses cr4zymanz0r PS1 De-Dither code to patch the .bin files,
all the credit for the patching code goes to him. Link to his github:
